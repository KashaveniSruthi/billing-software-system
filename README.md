# Billing Software in Python

This repository contains a Python-based billing software application designed to help businesses manage their billing and accounting processes. The software allows users to create invoices, track payments, and manage customer data with an intuitive interface built using the Tkinter library.

## Features
- **Product Management:** Add and manage products across categories like groceries, cold drinks, and medical supplies.
- **Invoice Generation:** Create detailed invoices for customers.
- **Tax Calculation:** Automatically calculate applicable taxes for invoices.
- **Customer Management:** Store and manage customer details.
- **Billing Area:** Generate and display bills dynamically.
- **Interactive GUI:** Easy-to-use graphical interface powered by Tkinter.
- **Error Handling:** Ensures accurate calculations with robust condition checks.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python 3.10
- Tkinter library (pre-installed with Python)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/billing-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd billing-system
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install any required Python packages (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python billing-sytem.py
   ```
2. Use the graphical interface to:
   - Add products to different categories.
   - Generate and view bills in the bill area.
   - Save or print invoices.

## How It Works

### 1. Import Required Libraries
The software uses the Tkinter library for GUI development. Ensure Tkinter is installed on your system.

### 2. Class and Variables
The core logic is encapsulated within a Python class that manages variables such as product categories, prices, and customer details.

### 3. Adding Products
Products are categorized (e.g., Grocery, Cold Drinks, Medical). Buttons allow adding products to the bill.

### 4. Calculations
The total product price, taxes, and final amount are calculated automatically when generating a bill.

### 5. Bill Area
A text area displays the generated bill dynamically.

### 6. Buttons and Functionality
Interactive buttons enable users to:
- Add items to the bill
- Calculate totals
- Generate invoices

### 7. Conditional Logic
If-else statements handle validation and logical checks (e.g., ensuring the user enters customer details before generating a bill).
